        As our company has grown and our software has evolved, our focus has remained unchanged since the inception of People's Store in 1999.
        We provide effective online tools to help businesses small and large achieve success online.
        This, combined with our desire for excellence in customer service, has allowed us to help our customers grow their businesses from small start-ups
        to multi-million dollar enterprises time and time again. It's no wonder why over 25,000 businesses world-wide sell online with People's Store.
        What's our formula for success? Simple. A centralized and automated solution to manage all aspects of an eCommerce business -
        reducing operational costs and increasing efficiency. eCommerce is most successful when it is integrated directly with online marketing tools.
        And, when businesses grow tired of paying too much for multiple software products or want to alleviate the hassle of numerous, disconnected systems,
        they turn to 1ShoppingCart®. We see it everyday.<br>
        Our Team
        People's Store is operated primarily from our SEEPZ, Mumbai, India office. Our company has partnered with a variety of solution providers
        throughout the world to offer the highest quality of service and security. Our software is designed, developed, maintained, and supported from
        our office in India.
